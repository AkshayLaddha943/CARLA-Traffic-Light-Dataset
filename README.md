# CARLA-Traffic-Light-Dataset

This repository contains the CARLA_Image_dataset folder comprising of Images for Traffic Light Detection divided into Green, Yellow, Red and Null (Negative Instances) and also the Camera_sensor.ipynb script which connects with the Carla Client environment, loads the environment, sets up an RGB Sensor Camera with given coordinates for its position and saves the images to the disk. The coordinates of the RGB camera can be tuned based on your CARLA Environment.
